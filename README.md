(PMID: 38530358), published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation. 

Sequencing data is deposited at SRA: PRJNA1071073

The data was originally sequenced by COSMOS (2x150 bp Illumina data, Nextera XT library). As part of this project, it has been processed by Cosmos, and also with Biobakery 4 (MetaPhlAn 4.0.6, ChocoPhlAn Oct_2022, HUMAnN 3.6). 

Code for all R analysis of sequencing data in this paper is included in this repository.
